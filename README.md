# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate with PSR-4

This project is based on the [WordPress Plugin
Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) project.

## Contents

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate includes the following files:

* `.gitignore`. Used to exclude certain files from the repository.
* `CHANGELOG.md`. The list of changes to the core project.
* `README.md`. The file that you're currently reading.
* A `plugin-name` subdirectory that contains the source code - a fully
executable WordPress plugin.

## Installation

The Boilerplate can be installed in one of two ways both of which are
documented below. Note that because of its directory structure, the Boilerplate
cannot be installed “as-is.”

Instead, the options are:

### Copying a Directory

1. Copy the `trunk` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory. You may
wish to rename this to something else.
2. In the WordPress admin area, navigation to the *Plugins* page Locate the
menu item that reads "The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate."
3. Click on *Activate.*

# Credits

This simple project is a basically a refactoring of the work created by [Tom
McFarlin](http://twitter.com/tommcfarlin/) and others: [WordPress Plugin
Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate).

## Documentation, FAQs, and More

Because this version is a major rewrite of the core plugin, we're working to
create an entire site around the Boilerplate. If you're interested, please [let
me know](http://devinvinson.com/contact/) and we'll see what we can do.
